# Computer Architecture

This repository contains the assignments for the Academic Courses "Computer Architecture" taught in the Fall of 2020-2021 in Aristotle University of Thessaloniki - Electrical and Computer Engineering.

The purpose of this project is the familiarization with **gem5**, which is a software that simulates the execution of Processors. Through three laboratory series, we acquired a deeper understanding of the modification of certain CPU parameters, such as L1 cache size, L1 cache associativity, L2 cache size, L2 cache associativity and Cache Line size and their influence in the performance of the system, measured in CPI. All this modifications have to be done with respect to a Cost function, that illustrates the physical cost of the designed system. Finally, the last laboratory assignment offered us the chance to combine gem5 with **McPAT**, which is an integrated Power, Area and Timing modeling framework for Multicore and Manycore architectures from HP-Labs. This software revealed us the energy measurements of each Processor and its hardware components.

Each laboratory series is represented by a corresponding directory, which contains a report and all the files that was used, during the implementation.
